<h2>Professional Background</h2>
<p> Greetings!  I am a 22-year-old senior at Northwest Missouri State University. Pursing a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Business Technology with an emphasis in Web Development. I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, and technology has always been a pivotal aspect in my life. I decided at a very young age that whatever I did in my future career; it would revolve around technology in some way. Throughout my college career, I took classes that focused on a mixture of business and technology. My classes ranged from advanced Microsoft Excel, Word, Access Database, Computer Programming, to Marketing, Management, Accounting, and Management Information Systems. I have created this website using HTML and CSS code to display my skills learned over the years. <i> The best way to reach me is through email:

    Or Mobile: <a href="tel:888-555-5555"> 888-555-555</a></i>
